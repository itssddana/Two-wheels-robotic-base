### Overview
This project involves designing a lightweight two-wheel robot base using provided components. The robot base is optimized for minimal weight and compact dimensions while maintaining functionality. The base and components were designed to adhere to the following constraints:
Weight: 12.5 grams (including the base and all components).
Dimensions:
Width: 110 mm
Length: 100 mm
Height: 38 mm

### Components
Wheel
Dimensions:
Diameter: 30 mm
Width: 5 mm
Weight: ~3 grams

Motor Fixer
Dimensions:
Length: 50 mm
Width: 20 mm
Height: 10 mm
Weight: ~4 grams

Motor Gear
Dimensions:
Length: 40 mm
Width: 20 mm
Height: 20 mm
Weight: ~5 grams

### Features
Compact and lightweight base design.
Support for motor integration with secure fixing points.

### Design Process
The project was designed using CAD tools, adhering to the following steps:
Component Analysis: The dimensions and weights of the components were estimated based on standard measurements.
Base Design: A lightweight base with open-frame structures was created to reduce weight while maintaining structural integrity.
Assembly: Components were integrated virtually to ensure compatibility and adherence to size constraints.

### Files
wheel.SLDPRT: Design file for the robot wheel.
motorFixer.sldprt: Design file for the motor fixer.
MotorGear01.SLDPRT: Design file for the motor gear.

### Future Work
Add support for sensors and battery integration.
Optimize weight distribution for better stability.
Develop a complete motion simulation to test performance.
